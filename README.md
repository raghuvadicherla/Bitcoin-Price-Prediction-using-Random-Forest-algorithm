# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-algorithm
To predict the price of Bitcoin using the Random Forest algorithm, we can use Python with the scikit-learn library, along with pandas and numpy for data manipulation. 
Project Outline: 

Data Collection: We will use a dataset of historical Bitcoin prices such as daily close prices.

Data Preprocessing: We will clean the data and create additional features like moving averages.

Train-Test Split: We will split the data into training and test sets.

Model Training: We'll use a Random Forest Regressor to train the model.

Prediction and Evaluation: We'll evaluate model accuracy and make predictions.
